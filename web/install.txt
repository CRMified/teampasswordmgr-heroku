Requirements

Also online: http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/requirements/

Team Password Manager is a web application that is installed on a web/application server
and is viewed from a browser. These are the exact requirements:

Server:
	
	- Environment: for security reasons we advise the execution of Team Password Manager on at least 
	a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or a dedicated server. Do not use a shared server. Also, use https 
	(encrypted connection from the browser to the server).
	- Operating system: any operating system that can execute the next components. We have tested 
	Team Password Manager on a number of Linux distributions, FreeBSD, Windows systems and OSX (x86). We've 
	seen problems installing Team Password Manager on PHP x64 for Windows. From http://windows.php.net: "The 
	x64 builds of PHP for Windows should be considered experimental, and do not yet provide 64-bit integer 
	or large file support".	So if using Windows please use PHP / Apache 32 bit.
	- Web server: Apache 2 with mod_php.
	- Database: MySQL 5.x. Better MySQL 5.6+ for maximum performance. Note: if using MySQL 5.7, ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode cannot be used.
	- PHP 5.6.0 or newer (PHP 7 supported) with the following PHP extensions or modules:
		- Mcrypt library. See http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php.
		- GD2 Extension. See http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php. GD2 is only required for 
		generating the QR codes needed to configure two-factor authentication. It's not required to execute 
		Team Password Manager and the installer doesn't check if it's installed. You'll still be able to 
		configure two-factor authentication without QR codes, but it's much easier with them.
		- MySQLi extension. See http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php.
		- Multibyte string (mbstring) extension. See http://www.php.net/mbstring.
		- LDAP support. See http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ldap.php. This is only required if you want 
		to use LDAP authentication.
		- The Hash extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.hash.php)
		must be installed and the "sha256" algorithm present.
	- A note on PHP 5.6+ (but not PHP 7): if you're using PHP 5.6+ make sure the following is set in php.ini: always_populate_raw_post_data = -1
	- The ionCube PHP Loader extension. We provide instructions to install this extension if itâ€™s not already installed.
	- A note for FreeBSD: the installation of PHP for FreeBSD considers the following PHP extensions as optional and doesn't install them by default. You should: session, hash and json.
	
Client (browser): use recent versions of the following browsers:

	- Mozilla Firefox
	- Internet Explorer.
	- Google Chrome.
	- Apple Safari.
	- Opera.
	
	Cookies must be activated.
	Javascript needs to be enabled. 
	Flash must be installed in the browser if you want to use the Flash "Copy to clipboard" button (COPY_TO_CLIPBOARD=zeroclipboard or flash).
	
	
Install

Also online: http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/install/

We assume you already have a working installation of Apache, PHP and MySQL. Follow these
steps to install Team Password Manager:

1. Install the ionCube Loader:

	- Check to see if it's already installed: create a php file on your server (ex: phpinfo.php) 
	with the following command: 
	
	<?php phpinfo(); ?> 
	
	and open it with your browser. If the ionCube Loader is installed you should see the 
	following line (usually in the third box before PHP credits): 
	
	"...with the ionCube PHP Loader vx.x.x ..."

	If the ionCube Loader is not installed, install it:
	
	- Download the ionCube Loader Wizard (http://www.ioncube.com/loader-wizard/loader-wizard.zip 
	or http://www.ioncube.com/loader-wizard/loader-wizard.tgz).
	- Decompress and copy the wizard script (loader-wizard.php) into your web server.
	- Open the script on your browser and follow instructions.
	
	- Important: at the end of this step (or at the end of the install process), make sure you delete
	  the phpinfo file. It is not needed for Team Password Manager to run and it's giving away
	  information about your server.

2. Create the database in MySQL

You have to create the database that will store Team Password Manager data. Make sure the database
user has enough privileges to create tables and insert/delete data.

You can use the following commands in the MySQL prompt or in phpMyAdmin:

CREATE DATABASE `tpm_database` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `tpm_database`.* TO `tpm_user`@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tpm_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

These commands create a database called tpm_database and a user called tpm_user with password tpm_password 
with all privileges on tpm_database.

3. Upload the files to the server

Decompress the Team Password Manager file (teampasswordmanager_x.x.x.zip) and upload the resulting
files and folders to the server web root.

4. Fill in the configuration file

The configuration file config.php contains the database parameters that Team Password Manager uses:

- CONFIG_HOSTNAME: hostname of the machine where the database executes. Usually localhost.
- CONFIG_USERNAME: username to access the database server and the database created in step 2.
- CONFIG_PASSWORD: the password for the username. There needs to be a password, a blank one is not valid.
- CONFIG_DATABASE: the name of the database created in step 2.

5. Execute the installer

Point your browser to web_location_of_Team Password Manager_files/index.php/install (Example:
http://teampasswordmanager.mydomain.com/index.php/install) and follow the instructions.

If everything is correct you have now a working Team Password Manager system. This is the Free Version, so
you only have two users and a maximum of five projects. If you need more users and projects you 
should purchase one or more licenses (http://teampasswordmanager.com/buy/) and register them.

If you get the Internal Server Error 500 when executing the installer, see the document called 
Troubleshooting Internal Server Error 500, located at: http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/error_500/.

6. Register licences (optional)

Log into Team Password Manager with the user created on step 5 by the installer and click on "Settings"
on the top menu. Go to the "Licenses" tab, click "Add a license" and fill in the license data sent to you by e-mail.

7. Move the program files outside of webroot (optional)

For increased security you can place most of the files of Team Password Manager outside webroot, thus 
protecting them from direct Internet access.

The files that need to be "visible" are: index.php, folder.php, the css folder and the import folder. 
All the other files and folders can be located anywhere else on your system. This location is then 
entered in the APP_FOLDER parameter on the folder.php file. See folder.php for more instructions.

8. Make the 'import' folder writable by the web server

This folder is used by the import process. Give it 666 or 777 permissions so that Team Password Manager 
can write in it.

9. Make the 'uploads' folder writable by the web server

This folder is used to store files uploaded in passwords and projects. Give it 666 or 777 permissions so that Team Password Manager 
can write in it. You can also change its default location. Check config.php.

10. Copy additional language files to 'wmm/language'

Team Password Manager comes by default with the English language files (in the 'wmm/language/en' folder). If you want your installation
to have more languages available you can downlowad them from http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/language-files/ and copy them to the 'wmm/language' folder.

For more information see http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/languages/.

11. We advise you to delete the following files from your Team Password Manager folder: install.txt, eula.txt and upgrade.txt.
