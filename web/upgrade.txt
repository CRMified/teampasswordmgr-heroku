Upgrade instructions for Team Password Manager v. 7.x and up

IMPORTANT: v. 7.x+ of Team Password Manager requires at least PHP 5.6.
Make sure you have the appropriate version of PHP in your system. In addition, if you need to use
two-factor authentication, you'll need the GD2 library to be able to generate QR codes (you'll
still be able to configure two-factor authentication without QR codes, but it's much easier with them.)

To upgrade your installation of Team Password Manager to the latest version
follow the next steps.

As a safety measure, make a complete backup of your current installation of 
Team Password Manager before executing these steps. Be sure to backup the files and
also the database tables.

1. Download the latest version of Team Password Manager 
from http://teampasswordmanager.com/download/

2. Decompress the downloaded file on your computer. You'll get a bunch of files and folders. 
The important ones are the 'css', 'import', 'system', 'uploads' and 'wmm' folders, and the 'index.php' file.

3. Replace the 'css', 'import', 'system' and 'wmm' folders and the 'index.php' file from your 
installation of Team Password Manager with the new ones. Note: be careful not to overwrite config.php and folder.php.

Note: Team Password Manager comes by default with the English language files (in the 'wmm/language/en' folder). If you have additional language files you'll need to reinstall them afterwards, so be sure to copy them before replacing the 'wmm' folder. For more information see http://teampasswordmanager.com/docs/languages/.

4. If you don't have a folder called 'import', copy it from the decompressed files and make 
it writable by the web server (give it 666 or 777 permissions). If this folder already exists, make sure it is writable.

5. If you don't have a folder called 'uploads', copy it from the decompressed files and make 
it writable by the web server (give it 666 or 777 permissions). If this folder already exists, make sure it is writable. 

6. Execute the upgrade procedure by pointing your browser to 
web_location_of_teampasswordmanager_files/index.php/upgrade (Example:
http://teampasswordmanager.mydomain.com/index.php/upgrade) and follow the 
instructions. If you get a blank screen instead, it's possible that you need to update the Ioncube loader. Please check the
logs in this case.

7. We advise you to delete the following files from your Team Password Manager folder: install.txt, eula.txt and upgrade.txt.
